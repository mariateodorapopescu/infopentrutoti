# infopentrutoti
InfoPentruToti is a small webpage with notes and articles related to programming and Computer Science in Romanian language <br>
You can see the page's improvement in time via v1, v2, v3 and v4 branches <br>
<i> Note that the resizing of the iFrame from v4 used to work on older versions of web browsers such as Google chrome, Mozilla, and even Microsoft Edge. However, it does not work now. The project/page was discontinued in 2019 so there were not done any other modificationbs to it. In a nutshell, this page does not work in normal parameters. </i> <br>
v1, v2, v3 do not use iframes. To this day, I am not quite sure the resize / responsiveness work. v1 was made when I was in the 9th grade *though this page was created then)
